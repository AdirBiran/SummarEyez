  "Title": "Nelson Mandela: A Powerful Symbol of the Fight for Blacks Rights in South Africa",
  "Text": "World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement Saturday of Nelson R.  Mandela's impending release from prison, and international rejoicing began to  build for an event so long awaited by so many.    Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South  Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure  on the white-led government. @@ President Bush praised South African President Frederik W. de Klerk for 'bold  and imaginative leadership,' and the Canadian government expressed delight at  the announcement that Mandela would be released today.    In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, whose country has been a refuge  for the exiled leadership of Mandela's African National Congress, said his  first reaction was to kneel down and thank God.    'Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of South Africa to put  their heads together and build on these developments,' Kaunda said.    Hours after the announcement of Mandela's release date, the ANC's leadership  announced from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia: 'We welcome Nelson Mandela  back from all those years of imprisonment into our midst with great joy.'    'Ireland rejoices that Nelson Mandela is free at last,' said Charles Haughey,  Irish prime minister and current president of the European Community, which has  been using economic sanctions to pressure Pretoria to give up apartheid.    'By his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that the human  spirit can never be vanquished,' Haughey said.    Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, current chairman of the Organization of  African Unity, sent Mandela a message of congratulation, praising the  'sacrifices of the great people of South Africa' and assuring him of Egyptian  solidarity with his cause.    In the Soviet Union, Moscow Radio broadcast news of the announcement, then  added: 'Nelson Mandela has become the world's most famous political prisoner,  put in jail for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.'    Amsterdam's central Leidseplein square was temporarily rechristened Nelson  Mandela Square.    In London, a jubilant crowd of about 120, some waving pictures of Mandela,  celebrated in the pouring rain outside South Africa House in Trafalgar Square.    In a statement released by her 10 Downing St. office, Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher said, 'We believe that the steps President de Klerk has taken merit a  positive, practical response.'    'We believe it no longer makes sense to discourage new investment in South  Africa -- a restraint which in our case in any event has been voluntary -- and  we shall be discussing this with our EC partners,' she said.   @@ In 1986, the European Community banned imports of South African iron, steel and  Kruggerand gold coins, and barred new investment in the country. It had already  frozen scientific and cultural relations.    Britain regards the iron, steel and coin embargoes as mandatory, but not the  investment ban, and has already announced that it is no longer observing the  scientific and cultural embargo.    In London, Bob Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said he was  delighted at the news, which he called 'a tremendous victory for the people of  South Africa and for the international sanctions campaign.'    Commonwealth Secretary General Shridath Ramphal said Mandela's safety must be  guaranteed by the South African government and that until change there becomes  irreversible, the Commonwealth will sustain its pressure for the end of  apartheid. 'It is not yet time to demobilize the international support for  apartheid's victims,' he said.",
