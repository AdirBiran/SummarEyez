  "Title": "Humanitarian Contributions in the Race of Life: Jesse Owens",
  "Text": "The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the 1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitler's boasts of racial superiority, picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for ``humanitarian contributions in the race of life.'' President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his widow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attended by three daughters and teammates of the track legend. @@ This Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of Owens' death at age 66. The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medals in the Berlin games ``a victory for humanity'' in prepared remarks to a banquet sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee. ``The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue _ a way that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition, not deadly conflict,'' Bush said. Bush called Owens, who was black, an ``Olympic hero and an American hero every day of his life ... born with the gift of burning speed.'' ``He was always the fastest,'' said Bush, recalling the afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes. ``Talk about a guy in a hurry,'' Bush laughed. ``He was the epitome of that.'' At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four gold medals _ in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and 400-meter relay. ``The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitler's theories on the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kid'' showed up, Bush said. ``It was an unrivaled athletic triumph. But more than that, it really was a triumph for all humanity.'' Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those athletic feats but ``his humanitarian contributions in the race of life'' that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal. Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as ``a special ambassador for sports,'' said Bush. He said the athlete's legacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playground Olympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletes and the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needy youth. @@ ``Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth,'' said Mrs. Owens, 74. Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were former Olympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; former teammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and two Ohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, who spearheaded the drive to strike the medal. The silver-haired Mrs. Owens, standing outside the White House afterwards, called the event ``absolutely beautiful.'' She added: ``I'm sure with the sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us, too.''",
